K Means Clustering of Global Happiness Ranking

The goal of this project is to train an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster countries based on features such as economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. This project utilized The World Happiness Report of 2017 from the United Nations (UN).

In the case study, The World Happiness Report ranks global happiness by country. The happiness scores and ranking data was collected by asking individuals to rank their life from 0 to 10, 10 being the best possible life. We will be training an unsupervised machine learning model to cluster countries based on which features have the highest impact on a countries' happiness ranking.
